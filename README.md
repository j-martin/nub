# nub

`bench-hub` -> `bhub` -> `nub` -> `nub` a developer workflow cli tool initially developed
during my time at [bench.co](https://bench.co) and now a [Nesto](https://nesto.ca).

## Warning / Disclaimer

Everything here is experimental and the commands are subject to, and will,
change. Also, when listing the manifests the list is also incomplete, until each
project is properly updated. Also the tool in it's current state largely depends
on the toolchain of my current employer. E.g. Migrating from AWS to GCP. Refer
to [Bench Era](../../tree/bench-era) branch for integration with AWS, CircleCI, Vault, Manifest
and Splunk, etc.
